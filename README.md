**Timestamped public disclosure of PrivateMind™ assistant architecture and functional logic by Michael Spanne.**

This repository serves as the official public record of the conceptual and technical foundation for *PrivateMind™*—a modular, privacy-centric AI assistant designed to prioritize user control, emotional intelligence, and secure local processing.

## 🔒 Purpose of Disclosure

To establish prior art and protect intellectual integrity by documenting:
- The assistant’s modular architecture

- **Task Routing Hub** — Handles reminders, diagnostics, emotional check-ins, and scam narration
